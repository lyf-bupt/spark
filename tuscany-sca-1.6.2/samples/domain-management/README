Domain Management Sample Tasks
==============================
This sample shows how to use a subset of Tuscany to read contribution metadata, 
analyze and resolve contribution dependencies given a set of available contributions.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there first.

If you want to run this sample to see what happens, open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and run any of the sample domain management tasks
as follows:

Running the Sample
------------------

1. List deployables in a contribution:
  ------------------------------------

   - This sample reads the SCA metadata for two sample contributions and prints the names of their deployable composites.

   - Use the following command to run the sample:

    ant runListDeployables

   - OR if you don't have ant,
    
    On windows do:
    java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListDeployables 

    On *nix do:         
    java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListDeployables

   - You should see the following output:
    
    Deployable: {http://store}store

2. List contribution dependencies:
  --------------------------------

   - The sample reads the SCA metadata for two sample contributions and prints their dependencies.

   - Use the following command to run the sample:

    ant runListDependencies

   - OR if you don't have ant,
    
    On windows do:
    java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListDependencies
    
    On *nix do: 
    java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListDependencies

   - You should see the following output:

    Contribution: store
    dependency: assets
    dependency: store
    Contribution: assets
    dependency: assets

3. Add deployables to a domain composite and wire them:
  -----------------------------------------------------

   - The sample first reads the SCA metadata for three sample contributions, and resolve the artifacts contained in the contributions,  
     includes all their deployable composites in a composite model representing an SCA domain, and then
     uses several composite builder utilities to configure and assemble and wire them together.
     Finally it prints the resulting domain composite model, showing service bindings
     configured with the URIs from the nodes hosting them.

   - Use the following command to run the sample:

    ant runWireComponents

   - OR if you don't have ant,
    
    On windows do:
    java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-domain-management.jar manager.WireComponents      

    On *nix do: 
    java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-domain-management.jar manager.WireComponents

   - You should see the following output:
    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <composite name="domain" targetNamespace="http://sample"
            xmlns="http://www.osoa.org/xmlns/sca/1.0" xmlns:ns1="http://www.osoa.org/xmlns/sca/1.0">
        <component name="ShoppingCart" uri="ShoppingCart">
            <implementation.java class="services.ShoppingCartImpl"/>
            <service name="Cart">
              <ns2:binding.atom name="Cart" uri="/ShoppingCart/Cart" xmlns:ns2="http://tuscany.apache.org/xmlns/sca/1.0"/>
            </service>
        </component>
        <component name="ShoppingCartClient" uri="ShoppingCartClient">
            <implementation.java class="services.ShoppingCartClientImpl"/>
            <service name="Cart">
              <ns2:binding.atom name="Cart" uri="/ShoppingCartClient/Cart" xmlns:ns2="http://tuscany.apache.org/xmlns/sca/1.0"/>
            </service>
            <reference name="cart">
              <ns2:binding.atom name="cart#ShoppingCart/Cart"
                uri="/ShoppingCart/Cart" xmlns:ns2="http://tuscany.apache.org/xmlns/sca/1.0"/>
            </reference>
        </component>
    </composite>

4. List Components:
  -----------------
    
   - This sample reads the SCA metadata for two sample contributions, and displays their dependencies, reads and resolve 
     the artifacts contained in the contributions, and finally prints the deployables composites and the components
     they declare as well as their main characteristics (showing that their interfaces and implementations are actually resolved).

   - Use the following command to run the sample:

    ant runListComponents

   - OR if you don't have ant,
    
    On windows do:  
    java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListComponents

    On *nix do:     
    java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-domain-management.jar manager.ListComponents

   - You should see the following output:

    Deployable: {http://store}store
      component: ShoppingCart
        componentService: Cart
          binding: class org.apache.tuscany.sca.binding.atom.impl.AtomBindingImpl - /ShoppingCart/Cart
        implementation: services.ShoppingCartImpl
          service: Cart
            interface: services.Cart

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows:

cd domain-management
ant compile
ant runListDeployables
ant runListDependencies
ant runWireComponents
ant runListComponents


Building the Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------

cd domain-management
mvn

** Please note that the mvn command will just build the sample and will install the required jar files into the Maven repository.
** In order to run the sample, please see the instructions - "Running the Sample"
