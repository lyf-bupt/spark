Mortgage Loan Approval Demo
===========================

This demo was used as an example in the Java Developer Journal article:  http://jdj.sys-con.com/read/325183.htm.

The demo consists of two modules:

mortgage-loanapproval: provides the business logic for loan approval.  
mortgage-creditcheck: handles credit check requests. This is a java component exposed as a webservice running on the embedded Tomcat.

Please check the mortgage_assembly.png file that is located in this directory for a high level view of the demo.

When you run the mortgage-loanapproval application, a loan approval request for a customer with id 111-222-3333 
is initiated. This invokes the mortgage-creditcheck application to determine the credit status of the customer.
Depending on what the credit status of this person is, the loan is approved or diapproved. 

You need two command windows to run this demo. The order in which the applications are run is important.
Run mortgage-creditcheck first since mortgage-loanapproval is dependent on it.

In the first command window 
---------------------------
cd mortgage-creditcheck 
ant run

You should see the following displayed:
Buildfile: build.xml
