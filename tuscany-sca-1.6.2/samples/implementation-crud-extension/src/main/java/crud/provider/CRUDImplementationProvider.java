/**
 * An implementation provider for sample CRUD implementations.

 * by the implementation.
 * 
 * The start() and stop() methods are called when a component is started
 * and stopped.
 *
 * The createInvoker method is called for each operation provided by the component
 * implementation. The implementation provider can create an invoker and initialize it
 * at that time to minimize the amount of work to be performed on each invocation.
