Architecture. SCA is a set of specifications aimed at simplifying SOA
Application Development which are being standardized at OASIS as part
of Open Composite Services Architecture (Open CSA) - http://www.oasis-opencsa.org/.

     main SCA specifications including:

        SCA Assembly Model V1.0

    It also includes implementations of many features not yet defined
    by SCA specifications, including:

        - SCA bindings for Direct Web Remoting, RSS and ATOM Feeds, 
          HTTP resources, JSON-RPC, PUB/SUB Notifications, and RMI.
        - SCA implementation types for OSGI, XQuery, BPEL, Widget and various 
          dynamic languages including Groovy, Javascript, Python and Ruby

        - running standalone 
        - running with distributed nodes across multiple JVMs
        - running with embedded Jetty or Tomcat
        - running as part of a standard web application

        - Tomcat 5.5.20 and Tomcat 6.0.14
        - Jetty 6.1.3
        - Geronimo 2.0.2 Tomcat6 jee5

Notes:

1. The following Tuscany runtime modules are distributed via the maven repository only and are
   not included in the binary distribution:
    tuscany-binding-sca-corba-1.6.2.jar   (conflicts with tuscany-binding-sca-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-host-corba-jee-1.6.2.jar      (conflicts with tuscany-host-corba-jse-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-node-launcher-osgi-1.6.2-jar  (needs dependencies not in binary distro lib directory)
    tuscany-policy-transaction-1.6.2.jar  (has dependency conflicts with binary distro lib directory)

2. The following Tuscany runtime modules are included in the binary distribution but are not included
   in tuscany-sca-all-1.6.2.jar and tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:
    tuscany-binding-atom-js-dojo-1.6.2.jar     (conflicts with tuscany-binding-atom-js-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-binding-jsonrpc-js-dojo-1.6.2.jar  (conflicts with tuscany-binding-jsonrpc-js-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-host-tomcat-1.6.2.jar              (conflicts with tuscany-host-jetty-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-implementation-widget-runtime-dojo-1.6.2.jar  (conflicts with tuscany-implementation-widget-runtime-1.6.2.jar)
    tuscany-web-javascript-dojo-1.6.2.jar      (conflicts with tuscany-web-javascript-1.6.2.jar)
   If these files are needed at runtime, the classpath must be set up to include these jars explicitly
   and exclude the jars for which conflicts are indicated above.

3. The Erlang binding and samples require Erlang/OTP to be installed. This isn't included in the
   binary distribution and must be downloaded and installed separately if required.

4. For samples, demos, and tutorials packaged as web applications (.war files), the .war files
   are omitted from the binary distribution to save space (except for the calculator sample).
   These .war files can be created using the ant scripts provided.

5. The Tuscany SCA Eclipse Tools Feature and Plug-in are distributed via the Tuscany Eclipse
   update site only.

6. Other Tuscany tools are distributed via the maven repository only, except for the following jar
   which is also included in the binary distribution:
    tuscany-wsdl2java-1.6.2.jar  (needed by the helloworld-bpel sample)
