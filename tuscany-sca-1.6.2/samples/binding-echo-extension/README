Binding Echo Sample
===================
This sample demonstrates how new bindings are constructed for Apache Tuscany 
SCA. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you want to try out the echo binding that this sample provides
please see the binding-echo sample that provides the necessary client and
application code to bring up an application that uses this binding

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a implementation of an SCA binding that simply echoes back 
any messages that are sent to it. 

binding-echo-extension/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        echo/                    - The binding interfaces
          impl/                  - The bindings model classes
          provider/              - The bindings runtime classes
          server/                - A dummy server that the binding is plugged into
      resources/
        META-INF/
          services/              - The extension declaration
    test/
      java/
        echo/                    - test code
      resources/
        EchoBinding.composite    - the SCA assembly used by the unit test
  build.xml                      - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                        - the Maven build file
  
Building The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built using Ant as 
follows

cd binding-echo-extension
ant compile

See the binding-echo sample to run a sample that uses this binding. 

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd binding-echo-extension
mvn

Maven will also test that the sample extension built properly. You should see 
the following output from the test phase.
